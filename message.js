  <p>Hey Prosperous Woman ðŸ’™,</p>

  <p>I thank God everyday for bringing you my way. 
  Just wanted to remind us of the wonderful journey our friendship has been. Every memory and shared experience has brought us closer together, and 
  I'm grateful for the journey we've shared, and I cherish every moment.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  I am captivated by how you carry yourself. 
  Your intentionality towards your growth, which is quite great.
  We've grown closer over the past year. Through our highs and lows, I've seen your true essence, your strengths, and vulnerabilities. 
  I'm privileged to witness your growth, and I'm super-duper proud of you.
   
  </p>

  <p>The last time we had a discussion, you said if the right
    person is here, a person would know. And yes I believe that.
    Sometimes they enter our lives when we least expect, catching us off guard.
  </p>
       
    <p>In respect to that, silly as it may sound, I've made an "executive"
    decision that I'd love to have my life with you.   

    </p>
        
    <p>Hear me out...ðŸ˜…</p>

    <div style= "border-radius: 8px; height:150px; overflow:hidden;">
        <img src="assets/hear-me-out.gif" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; display: block; margin: 16px auto; transform: translateY(-80px);" alt="Hear me out">
    </div>

    <p>
    I've never been so sure about anyone before. 
    I'm drawn to the authenticity of who you are. 
    Past experiences taught me to love people for who they are, not for the idea of them.
    </p>

    <p>I am not loving you out of loneliness, I was fine in the
    dark. 
    I am loving you because your light made me want to step out from the
    shadows.
    </p>

    <p>Remember when I mentioned getting you a Range Rover? 
    It wasn't just words. I saw you in my future, and I meant it.
    </p>

    <p>Walk with me...ðŸ˜…</p>

    <div>
        <img src="assets/walk-with-me.gif" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; display: block; margin: 16px auto;" alt="walk with me">
    </div>


  <p>As time has passed, my feelings for you have grown stronger, You're the woman I never knew I wanted in my life
  </p>  

  <p>   
  I've learnt that the more we connect and engage, the deeper my affection grows. 
  I want to be exclusive with you; you deserve nothing less than the best.
 </p>

  <p>There's much more to express, but I'll speak when you are done</p>
  
  <p>I'm certain with you by my side, we can build an empire
  together as architects that we areðŸ’™
  I want to fly around the world with you.  
  </p>
  
  <p>So, tell me, how do you want to be loved specifically? I am
  more than ready to learn your love language.
  </p>
