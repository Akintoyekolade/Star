  <p>Hey Prosperous WomanðŸ’™,</p>
  <p>I thank God everyday for bringing you my way. 
  Just wanted to remind us of the wonderful journey our friendship has been. Every memory and shared experience has brought us closer together, and 
  I'm grateful for the journey we've shared, and I cherish every moment.
  
  
  </p>
  
  <p>I am captivated by how you carry yourself. 
  Your intentionality towards your growth, which is quite great.
  We've grown closer over the past year. Through our highs and lows, I've seen your true essence, your strengths, and vulnerabilities. 
  I'm privileged to witness your growth, and I'm super-duper proud of you.
  
  
  </p>
  
    The last time we had a discussion, you said if the right
    person is here, a person would know. And yes I believe that.
    Sometimes they enter our lives when we least expect, catching us off guard.
    
    <p>In respect to that, silly as it may sound, I've made an "executive"
    decision that I'd love to have my life with you.   
    
    </p>
        Hear me out...ðŸ˜…

    </p>

  <p>However, as time has passed, my feelings for you have grown stronger, and I find myself hoping for something more than just a friendship. You are an incredible person, and the thought of exploring a romantic relationship with you fills me with joy and excitement.</p>
  
  <p>If you feel the same way, I would be honored to take you on a special date, where we can discuss our future and the possibility of taking our relationship to the next level. If not, I cherish our friendship dearly and will always be grateful for the bond we share.</p>
  
  <p>With love and hope,<br>[Your Name]</p>
